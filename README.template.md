This repo tracks my progress in [Advanced Placement][AP] [Project Lead the Way][PLTW] [Computer Science Principles][CSP], the second class in the [Project Lead the Way Computer Science][PLTW CSP] classes.

This repo is roughly organized by unit:

-   ## [`art`](/csp/art/) is unit 1

    -   [`turtles`][turtles folder] is lesson 1.1.
        <!--- -   [`115codefilesCSP`][115codefiles] is a set of 3 python turtle programs which move a robot around a maze. (Uncomment this when you use it)-->
        -   [`csp/art/turtles/project.py`][turtle project] is the lesson project.
    -   [`functions`][funcs] is lesson 1.2.

-   ## [`web`](/csp/web/) is unit 2

    -   `csp/web/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## `data` is unit 3

    -   `csp/data/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## `future` is unit 4

    -   `csp/future/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## Other projects at the [root](./csp/) are listed below

    -   Currently, there are no other projects.
